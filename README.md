# Digit-Recognizer

Given an image of a handwritten single digit, used Python to build a number of classification models, such as Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, Na√Øve Bayes, K Nearest Neighbor, and evaluated them using accuracy rate and ROC curve. Ran the selected model on local Spark and Azure to compare the efficiency. Adopted PCA, SVD, and LDA to do dimensionality reduction, and compared their effect on model performance and runtime.
